**Maison KOSÉ listing-page scraper** (Playwright, Selenium, Puppeteer, or the
2Captcha Scraping Browser API via CDP) — product listings, prices, brands,
stock and Japan's two consumption-tax rates, captcha solving, proxies,
fingerprints.

---

## Read this first: the site is `maison.kose.co.jp`, not `kose.com`

`kose.com` **resolves for nobody.** Measured 2026-09-18:

```
$ dig +short @8.8.8.8 kose.com A     # SERVFAIL, no answer
$ dig +norecurse @a.gtld-servers.net kose.com NS
kose.com.  172800  IN  NS  dns1.supremecenter.com.
kose.com.  172800  IN  NS  dns2.supremecenter.com.
$ dig +norecurse @162.210.102.140 kose.com SOA   # REFUSED
```

The domain is registered (GoDaddy, created 1998-11-30, paid to 2029) and
delegated to two nameservers that no longer serve the zone, so every resolver
returns SERVFAIL. That is a broken delegation, not a bot manager: there is
nothing at that name for anyone to fetch.

Kosé's actual online store is **[maison.kose.co.jp](https://maison.kose.co.jp/)**
(Maison KOSÉ) — which is where `www.kose.co.jp` sends a visitor, with its own
`<meta http-equiv="refresh">`. That is what this scraper reads.

## You do not need a 2Captcha key, a proxy, or a browser

Stated plainly rather than sold. Measured 2026-09-18 from a datacentre
address (netcup, Nuremberg, AS197540), against
`/site/cosmedecorte/c/c15_p3/`:

| request | result |
|---|---|
| `curl/8.5.0` | HTTP 200, 90,310 bytes |
| `python-requests/2.31.0` | HTTP 200, 90,310 bytes — byte-identical |
| a desktop Chrome User-Agent | HTTP 200, 90,310 bytes — byte-identical |
| **no `User-Agent` header at all** | HTTP 200, 90,310 bytes — byte-identical |
| 12 pages back to back, no delay | 12 × HTTP 200 |

and **zero captcha markers of any vendor across 13 captures** — no reCAPTCHA,
hCaptcha, Turnstile, DataDome, PerimeterX, Incapsula, Kasada or AWS WAF, no
`data-sitekey`, no challenge iframe, on listings, product pages, the site's
own 404 and an exhausted facet alike.

The grid is server-rendered into the first response, so a plain HTTP client
gets the whole page. The three browser engines are a convenience here, not a
necessity.

**What the paid products would buy you, if that changes or at volume:**

* **2Captcha solving** — if Kosé ever renders a challenge. Nothing in this
  repo says a captcha here could not be solved; there is simply none to
  solve today. The solver is wired and the run pays for it under the usual
  `--solve-captcha when-blocked` rule.
* **Proxies** — many addresses, for a run large enough that one would be
  conspicuous. A Japanese exit is *not* required: a German datacentre address
  is served the same pages.
* **The Scraping Browser API** — a managed browser with a persistent profile
  and no local Chromium to maintain.
* **Fingerprints** — a consistent device identity. Verified working here
  (a JP fingerprint applied, 24 products returned), not needed.

## Install

```bash
git clone https://github.com/2scraper/kose-scraper
cd kose-scraper
python3 -m venv .venv && . .venv/bin/activate
pip install -r requirements.txt            # core: beautifulsoup4, requests
pip install -r requirements-playwright.txt # then ONE engine
playwright install chromium
```

Install **exactly one** engine. playwright and pyppeteer pin incompatible
`pyee` versions and pyppeteer and selenium collide on `urllib3`; they do run
side by side in practice, but `pip check` reports the conflict and pip may
resolve it by downgrading something you wanted. Use a virtualenv per engine
if you need more than one.

## Use

```bash
# a brand's catalogue, three pages
python playwright_scraper.py \
    --url "https://maison.kose.co.jp/site/cosmedecorte/c/c15/" --pages 3

# the same thing by category id — the id is the only thing that selects one
python playwright_scraper.py --category c15 --pages 3

# a tag facet, which crosses brands
python playwright_scraper.py --tags "シワ改善,スキンケア" --pages 2

# one product page: adds volume, subcategory, colour count and release date
python playwright_scraper.py --mode product \
    --url "https://maison.kose.co.jp/site/onebykose/g/gMUSC/"

# no local browser at all
python scraper_api_client.py --key "$TWOCAPTCHA_KEY" \
    --url "https://maison.kose.co.jp/site/cosmedecorte/c/c15/"
```

Output is `kose_products.json` + `.csv` plus a `kose_products.meta.json`
sidecar. `python3 env_config.py` prints what was picked up from `.env`,
without printing secrets.

## What a run actually returns

Measured 2026-09-18 across four live runs — 216 rows over the category route,
the tag route and a product page:

| column | coverage |
|---|---|
| `title` `url` `sku` `brand` | 216 / 216 |
| `price` `currency` `tax_rate` | 216 / 216 |
| `in_stock` `image_url` | 216 / 216 |

Prices ran **¥495 to ¥264,000**. A 3-page run of `/c/c15/` returned **72
products, 72 distinct skus, status `complete`, exit 0**.

**All three engines agree.** Playwright, Selenium and pyppeteer were run
against the same two pages on the same day: **48 of 48 rows identical** on
sku, price, brand and stock.

### Columns worth knowing about

* **`tax_rate`** — Japan runs two consumption-tax rates and the prices here
  are tax-INCLUSIVE. 10% is standard; **8%** is the reduced rate on
  ingestibles, so a beauty supplement sits at 8% while the cream beside it is
  at 10%. Two tiles in 171 carried it. Computing a pre-tax figure from the
  wrong rate is wrong by two percent, silently, which is why it is a column.
* **`in_stock`** — read from the site's own button text as an ALLOWLIST, so a
  wording Kosé adds tomorrow reads as unknown rather than as a quiet "in
  stock". Verified in both directions: 19 of 171 measured tiles say
  現在購入頂けません or 予約受付終了.
* **`price_is_store_price`** — the site marks its own selling price with `※`,
  expanded on a product page as `Maison KOSÉ販売価格`. It says which of two
  different things a number is.
* **`variant_of`** — on a product row, the sku the page's own `rel=canonical`
  points at when that is a DIFFERENT product. It groups two sizes or shades
  of one item, and it exists as a column precisely so nobody uses the
  canonical as the row's URL — see the traps below.
* **`badges`** — the site's own `new` / `limited` / `online` flags, on 21% of
  rows. `limited` is often why a row vanishes between two runs.

### Columns this site does not have, and why

A column null on every row of every run should not exist, and removing one
needs the measurement written down:

* **no `original_price` / `discount_pct` / `lowest_price_30d`** — 360 price
  nodes surveyed and not one carries a struck-through, was- or reference
  price. There is no discount chain on this site, so there is no second view
  to reconcile a price against.
* **no `rating` / `review_count`** — absent from every tile and every product
  page's JSON-LD. The site publishes staff opinion pieces, which are
  editorial content by named employees rather than a score of anything.
* **no `locale`** — one market. No `hreflang` set, no `/en/`, `/site/en/` or
  `/global/` route (all 404), JPY on every row.
* **no `sort`** — the site offers no ordering control on either listing
  route, so there is nothing a run could have asked for.

## Traps that look like bugs

Each of these cost time to find and each is guarded by a check.

**The brand in a URL selects nothing.** `/site/xyz/c/c15/` returns
byte-identical bytes (97,017) to `/site/cosmedecorte/c/c15/`, and the page's
own `rel=canonical` rewrites it. Only the `cNN` addresses a category and only
the `gSKU` addresses a product. So `brand` is read from each TILE — and a tag
listing genuinely mixes brands, **11 of them across 72 rows** on a live run.

**A category listing walked past its end serves its LAST PAGE AGAIN.** Not a
404 and not an empty grid: `/c/c15_p14/` and `/c/c15_p15/` each return the
same 71,199 bytes as `/c/c15_p13/`, HTTP 200, with 16 real tiles on them. A
run that stopped on "a page came back empty" would never stop. This scraper
plans against the site's own `N／Mページ` counter — `/c/c15/` states 13 pages,
and 12 × 24 + 16 = 304 products is the whole of Cosme Decorté — and still
stops on "this page added no new sku". A TAG listing ends differently, with a
genuinely empty page, and publishes no counter at all.

**The wrong pagination parameter fails silently.** On a tag listing `?p=2`
works while `&pageno=2` and `&page=2` are ignored and return page 1 with HTTP
200. A run that built one of those would dedupe every page down to page 1's
rows and report a `complete` run holding a single page.

**A quarter of product pages canonicalise to a different product.** Measured
over 20: `/g/gJQBA/` is the 60 g cream and its `rel=canonical` points at
`/g/gJQGA/`, which is the 20 g one. Five of the twenty do this. A row built
from the canonical would link to the wrong product while its title, sku and
price described the right one, so the row's URL is built from the page's own
sku and the canonical goes in `variant_of`.

**A product page reuses the listing's tile class.** `c-product__item` appears
on `<div>`s for staff-review cards — 15 of them on one measured page — plus
an `awoo` recommendation block. A class-only selector would invent fifteen
products per product page, each with a `/staff/` URL and no sku. The tile
selector is element-qualified (`li.c-product__item`) and sees zero.

**Product-shaped links outnumber real tiles.** A grid page carries 48–57
`/g/g…/` hrefs against 24 tiles (and 107 under Selenium, where more of the
page's JavaScript has run). The extra links are carousel banners. Rows come
from tiles; the link count is only used to tell a broken parser apart from an
empty category.

**Zero is a real price and a real rank.** Prices reach six figures —
¥264,000 for one cream — so a parser that mishandles the comma turns that
into 264. Every fixture in the suite pins the value, not the coverage.

## Engine limits

* **Selenium cannot use an authenticated remote CDP endpoint.** chromedriver's
  `debuggerAddress` takes a bare `host:port` with nowhere to put a password.
  Playwright and pyppeteer authenticate on the WebSocket upgrade; use one of
  those with `--cdp-endpoint`.
* **Selenium's `--proxy-server` cannot authenticate at all.** Credentials are
  stripped and a warning printed rather than letting you believe otherwise.
* **pyppeteer is effectively unmaintained** and its own README points at
  Playwright.
* **Never set a proxy or a fingerprint over `--cdp-endpoint`.** The remote
  browser brings its own; the engines refuse the combination on purpose.
* **`--concurrency` is refused over `--cdp-endpoint`.** A Scraping Browser
  profile allows one live connection, so workers collide. Use several `pid`s,
  one run each.

## What has and has not been verified live

Honest about the gap, because §13 of this family's playbook says a claim is
measured or absent:

| path | status, 2026-09-18 |
|---|---|
| Playwright, listing / tags / product | **verified** — 72, 72 and 1 rows, exit 0 |
| Selenium, listing | **verified** — 48 rows, identical to Playwright's |
| pyppeteer, listing | **verified** — 48 rows, identical to Playwright's |
| Scraper API (`scraper_api_client.py`) | **verified** — 24 rows, 90,835 bytes, $0.0005 |
| `--fingerprint` (2Captcha Fingerprint API) | **verified** — JP fingerprint applied, 24 rows |
| credential masking in errors | **verified** — a deliberately wrong endpoint's password appears 0 times in the output, including in Playwright's own five-line call log |
| `--cdp-endpoint` (Scraping Browser) | **not verified here** — the profile available to this machine had expired (`401 deny_no_user`). Those credentials live about a day; the code path is the family's and is exercised by its siblings. |
| `--solve-captcha` | **never fired** — no challenge has been observed on this site at all |

## Exit codes

`0` ok · `1` crash · `2` bad usage · `3` blocked · `4` zero products ·
`5` remote API error · `6` partial

A run that finds nothing writes nothing — it will not replace last night's
good output with `[]`. Pass `--allow-empty` to opt out.

## Tests

```bash
python3 smoke_test.py          # offline, no engine library required
python3 smoke_test.py -v       # and say what each check looked at
pytest                         # the same suite, wrapped
```

Fixtures are cut verbatim from real captures and were verified to parse to
identical values to their untrimmed originals before being committed. The one
staff-review card in the product fixture has its author name and text
replaced with placeholders: it is there because the parser must IGNORE it,
and republishing a named employee's writing is a separate act from the site
showing it on its own page.

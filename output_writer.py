output_writer.py
-----------------
Shared row model + JSON/CSV writers used by all three engines.

Two modes, one row shape
------------------------
    --mode listing   /site/{brand}/c/{cNN}/            a category listing
                     /site/itemtags/list.aspx?tags=…   a tag listing
    --mode product   /site/{brand}/g/g{SKU}/           one product page

Both yield the SAME class. Maison KOSÉ publishes one leaf — a PRODUCT — and a
listing is a way of SELECTING products while a detail page is one product
described more fully. Unlike Montblanc, "more fully" here is NOT more rows: a
Kosé product page publishes a single `Product` block, never a `ProductGroup`
with `hasVariant`, so `--mode product` emits exactly one row per page. What it
adds is columns a tile does not carry — `subcategory`, `volume`,
`colour_count`, `release_date` — plus a structured price and availability
straight from the site's own JSON-LD.

The two listing ROUTES are one mode and not two, because they return the
identical tile markup and differ only in how they paginate. Splitting them
would have put the same parser behind two names and made `diff_runs.py`
refuse a comparison that is perfectly sound: a product is the same product
whether a category or a tag facet led to it.

Columns this site does NOT have, and the measurement behind each
----------------------------------------------------------------
CLAUDE.md §9: a column null on every row of every run should not exist, and
removing one needs the measurement written down so someone can put it back
with a better one. Counted 2026-09-18 over 171 tiles in 8 listing captures
and 4 product captures:

  `original_price` / `discount_pct` / `lowest_price_30d` — **absent, and this
  is the load-bearing one.** 360 price nodes were surveyed and not one
  carries a struck-through, was-, or reference price: every node is a single
  amount in `1,234円（税込）` shape. So there is no discount chain, and
  CLAUDE.md §4 is explicit that the tile-price overlay must be DELETED rather
  than ported when that is true — there is no second view to reconcile
  against, and an overlay would be dead code that looks load-bearing. The EU
  Omnibus 30-day-low column that mediamarkt-scraper needs has no counterpart
  in Japanese price-indication law and no node on this site.

  `rating` / `review_count` — absent from every tile and every product page's
  JSON-LD. The site does publish staff opinion pieces (`/staff/…`), which is
  editorial content by named employees rather than a customer rating, and it
  is not a score of anything.

  `locale` — absent, and it is a measurement rather than an oversight.
  maison.kose.co.jp is one market: no `hreflang` set at all, no `/en/`,
  `/site/en/` or `/global/` route (all 404), and every price in JPY. A locale
  column would hold `ja-jp` on every row of every run forever.

  `sort` — absent. The site exposes facet filters (category, price band) but
  no ordering control on either listing route, so there is no ordering to
  record and nothing a run could have asked for. That is the opposite of
  bbb-scraper, where the ordering decides WHICH rows are in the file and
  therefore had to be a column (CLAUDE.md §21).

What IS kept, byte-identical and in order, is the family prefix — `source`,
`scraped_at`, `url`, `sku`, `title` — so one column name works across the
family and a consumer reading several of these repos reads the same first
five columns in the same order (§9).

    a pair whose modes or sources differ. `source` is `maison.kose.co.jp` on
    every row of every run here, since the site is one host and one market;
    it is kept because consumers read these columns by name across the
    family.

    The `url` a run was pointed at is recorded for a reason specific to this
    site: the brand segment in a listing address selects nothing, so two
    runs whose URLs differ only there fetched the identical page. The
    sidecar records the page's own `rel=canonical` alongside, which is the
    address the site agrees with.

    `extra` carries facts about the run that are not about any single row.
    A listing run uses it for the site's OWN page counter — the `N／Mページ`
    it prints in the title and above the grid — recorded as
    `pages_available`, plus the canonical URL of the page that was read.
    Those belong to the run rather than repeated down a column.

    Two warnings live here rather than in a column, and both are this site's
    own arithmetic. A category listing publishes its total page count, so a
    run can PLAN against it and "complete" means what the word ought to mean:
    `/c/c15/` states 13 pages, and 12 × 24 + 16 = 304 products is the whole
    category. A TAG listing publishes no counter at all, so `pages_available`
    is None there — which means UNKNOWN and never zero, because capping a tag
    run at zero pages would turn a working route into an empty file.

    `pages_failed` lists the pages that did not yield data, by number.
    `pages_completed` alone was enough only while pages were fetched strictly
    in order, where "3 of 10 completed" could only mean 1-2-3: a count is not
    a description once pages can be fetched independently and page 3 can fail
    while 4 and 5 succeed. Recording the numbers keeps the sidecar honest

# Stop reasons that mean the run saw everything there was to see. Anything
# else ended the page loop early, so the result is only a partial view.
#
# "no_new_products" belongs here and "pagination_exhausted" is kept for the
# engines that still stop on a missing next-link: the first is a property of
# the DATA (a page contributed nothing not already seen, so the listing is
# over), while the second is a property of a CSS SELECTOR and is therefore
# the weaker signal — a renamed attribute looks identical to a short
# catalogue.
#
# On a CATEGORY listing there is a THIRD, stronger signal, and it is the
# site's own arithmetic: every page prints `N／Mページ`, so the number of
# pages is known from the first response rather than discovered by walking
# off the end. "page_cap_reached" is that stop reason.
#
# It is a COMPLETE run, and here it is complete in the strong sense: the site
# imposes no cap of its own, so the planned page count IS the whole category.
# `/c/c15/` states 13 pages and 12 × 24 + 16 = 304 products is all of Cosme
# Decorté (measured 2026-09-18).
#
# Planning against it is not merely an optimisation on this site, which is
# the part worth remembering. Walking off the end of a category returns the
# LAST PAGE AGAIN — byte-identical, HTTP 200, forever — rather than the empty
# grid Montblanc returns or the HTTP 500 that the same overshoot produces on
# BBB. A run that trusted "keep going until a page is empty" would never
# terminate. A TAG listing does end with an empty page, so the two routes
# want the same data-based stop for opposite reasons.
#
# "single_page_mode" is complete by construction: --mode product reads one
# page because one page is all there is. On this site that is also exactly
# one ROW — a Kosé product page publishes a single `Product` block, never a
# `ProductGroup` with variants.
# Note "parser_found_nothing" is deliberately ABSENT. A page Maison KOSÉ
# served that links to products and parsed to zero rows is OUR failure, not a
# complete answer, and a run that ends that way must not report `complete`
# (§20). Its exit code stays EXIT_NO_PRODUCTS — the catalogue question really
# was answered — so only the status and the stop_reason carry the distinction.
#
# It CAN fire on this site, which §20 says to check before adding the signal:
# rows are built from `li.c-product__item` tiles while `product_link_count`
# counts `/g/g…/` hrefs, and a grid page carries 28 of those against 24
# tiles. So a tile-markup change leaves the links intact and the rows at
# zero, which is precisely the case this reason exists to name.

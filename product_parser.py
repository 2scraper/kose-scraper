-----------------
Everything this repo knows about Maison KOSÉ. If you are writing a site fact
anywhere else, it belongs here (CLAUDE.md §1).

Which site this is, and why it is not `kose.com`
------------------------------------------------
`kose.com` is registered and does not resolve. Measured 2026-09-18: the .com
gTLD servers delegate it to `dns1.supremecenter.com` / `dns2.supremecenter.com`,
both of which answer **REFUSED** for the zone, so 8.8.8.8 and 1.1.1.1 both
return **SERVFAIL** and no client anywhere gets an address. It is a lame
delegation on a domain registered in 1998 and paid up to 2029, not a site
behind a bot manager — there is nothing at that name to scrape.

Kosé's actual storefront is `maison.kose.co.jp` (Maison KOSÉ), which is where
`www.kose.co.jp` sends a visitor with its own `<meta http-equiv="refresh">`.
That is the site this repo reads, and it is one market: Japanese, JPY, no
`hreflang` set and no `/en/` route (all three checked 2026-09-18). CLAUDE.md
§15's "run a SECOND country site" step is therefore answered by "there is
only one", and the diversity in the fixtures is across BRANDS and page KINDS
instead — which is where this site's traps turned out to live.

Three routes, and the brand segment in all of them is a LIE
-----------------------------------------------------------
    category listing   /site/{brand}/c/{cNN}/        paginates  /c/{cNN}_p{N}/
    tag listing        /site/itemtags/list.aspx?tags=A,B   paginates  &p={N}
    product detail     /site/{brand}/g/g{SKU}/

The `{brand}` segment selects nothing. Measured 2026-09-18: `/site/xyz/c/c15/`,
`/site/jillstuart/c/c15/` and `/site/cosmedecorte/c/c15/` return **byte-identical**
97,017-byte responses, and the page's own `rel="canonical"` rewrites all of
them to `/site/cosmedecorte/c/c15/`. Same on a product: `/site/zzz/g/gJLCW/`
serves the Cosme Decorté product. Only `cNN` and `g{SKU}` address anything.

Two consequences, both of which bit during the capture pass:

* **`brand` is read from the TILE, never from the URL.** A capture requested
  as `sekkiseiclearwellness/c/c68/` came back holding 11 ウルミナプラス
  products — the slug was ignored and the fixture was misnamed for an hour.
  Fixtures are named by `cNN` for that reason. And a tag listing genuinely
  mixes brands: `tags_shiwa_skincare_p1` carries five in 24 tiles, so there
  is no per-page brand to fall back on even if the URL were honest.
* **`category_from_url` keys on `cNN`**, and `canonical_url` prefers the
  page's own canonical over the address that was requested.

Two pagination conventions, and one of them repeats its last page
-----------------------------------------------------------------
Both listing routes publish `<link rel="next">`, which is CLAUDE.md §7's
layer 1 and leads `NEXT_PAGE_SELECTOR`. Layer 2 is `page_url()`, and it is
route-dependent — a category takes `_p{N}` glued onto the id, a tag listing
takes `?p={N}`. Layer 3, the data-based stop, is not optional here, because
each route ends differently and one of them ends by lying:

    /c/c15_p13/  is the last page (16 tiles).
    /c/c15_p14/  returns 71,199 bytes  -- byte-identical to p13.
    /c/c15_p15/  returns 71,199 bytes  -- byte-identical to p13.

    ?p=4  is the last page (6 tiles).
    ?p=5  returns a served page with ZERO tiles.

So a category overshoot is not a 404 and not an empty page: it is the last
page again, forever. A run that stopped on "no tiles" would never stop, and a
run that trusted a page count would be fine only until the catalogue changed
under it. `parse_listing` reports the site's own `N／Mページ` counter so the
engines can PLAN against it (§7 layer 2, with the site doing the arithmetic),
and the engines still stop on "this page added no new sku" (§7 layer 3).
Wrong parameters are silent rather than loud, which is the same trap from the
other side: `&pageno=2` and `&page=2` on a tag listing both return page 1
with HTTP 200.

Where the data is: no JSON-LD on a listing, one block on a product
-------------------------------------------------------------------
Counted before a line of parser was written, per §15 step 2:

    listing pages    0 `application/ld+json` blocks   (all 8 captures)
    product pages    1 block, `@type: Product`        (all 4 captures)

So CLAUDE.md §4's primary path does not exist on the route that matters most,
and the listing parser is built on the site's own tile markup instead —
which here is unusually good: `li.c-product__item` holding
`p.c-product__brand`, `p.c-product__product-name`, `p.c-product__price` and
a `/g/g{SKU}/` link. Coverage over 171 tiles in 8 listing captures: sku,
title, brand, price, image and tax rate all **171/171**.

`li.` is not decoration — it is the whole guard
-----------------------------------------------
A product DETAIL page reuses the class `c-product__item` on a `<div>` for
staff-review cards linking to `/staff/skincaredetail/…`. Measured on
`product_MUSC`: **15** of them. A class-only selector would invent fifteen
products per detail page, each with a `/staff/` URL and no sku — CLAUDE.md
§4's junk-link data theft wearing a new costume. The element-qualified
`li.c-product__item` sees zero, and `smoke_test.py` pins that.

The same page also carries an `awoo-product-list` recommendation block
(`awoo-product-name` ×15), which is the "similar products carousel" §4 warns
about. Both are excluded by construction rather than by a filter: the tile
selector names the element, and the detail parser reads the page's own
JSON-LD, never tiles.

Prices: one number, tax-inclusive, and no discount chain to reconcile
---------------------------------------------------------------------
360 price nodes surveyed across the captures. Every one is a single amount
in one of these shapes, and there is **no struck-through price anywhere**:

    1,234円（税込）        249 + 51 + 31 of the sampled nodes, by magnitude
    1,234円（税込）※       the same, with the footnote marker
    3,024円（税込/8%）※    the reduced rate -- 2 nodes, both on /c/c15_p10/

So §4's tile-price overlay is **deleted rather than ported**, which is what
that section says to do when a site has no discount chain: there is no second
view to reconcile against, and an overlay here would be dead code that looks
load-bearing. `price_source` records WHICH NODE was read (`tile` / `jsonld` /
`detail_dom`) instead, which keeps `diff_runs.py` honest about comparing like
with like.

The structured and displayed prices AGREE, which was checked rather than
assumed (§4): JLCW 7700/7,700円, MUSC 5940/5,940円, SIRY 3300/3,300円.

`※` is `Maison KOSÉ販売価格` — "the Maison KOSÉ selling price", the store's
own figure as opposed to a maker's suggested one. It is kept as
`price_is_store_price` rather than thrown away, because it says which of two
different things a number is.

`（税込/8%）` is Japan's reduced consumption-tax rate, which applies to
ingestible products — a beauty supplement sits at 8% while the cream beside
it is at 10%. It is a real column: two rows in 171 carry it, and a consumer
computing a pre-tax price from the wrong rate is wrong by two percent
silently.

Stock is read from the site's own button text, as an allowlist
---------------------------------------------------------------
Measured across the same 171 tiles, and this is CLAUDE.md §20's rule — map
availability as an ALLOWLIST so an unanticipated value reads as "not
available" rather than as a quiet True:

    種類を選ぶ         83   choose a variety      -> available
    カートに入れる      54   add to cart           -> available
    商品を購入する      12   purchase this product -> available
    予約受付中          3   pre-orders open       -> available
    現在購入頂けません   18   currently unavailable -> NOT available
    予約受付終了        1   pre-orders closed     -> NOT available

The column is verified in BOTH directions, which §20 says is otherwise not
verified at all: 19 of 171 tiles are unavailable, and the JSON-LD on
`gJQBA` independently says `OutOfStock` where its tile says 現在購入頂けません.

Detection: there is nothing to detect, and that is the measurement
-------------------------------------------------------------------
Every candidate marker was counted on pages known to be good BEFORE any was
added (§18), across all 13 captures including the site's own 404 and an
empty listing:

    recaptcha · grecaptcha · g-recaptcha · data-sitekey · api.js?render ·
    hcaptcha · turnstile · cf-turnstile · challenges.cloudflare.com ·
    datadome · px-captcha · _Incapsula_ · perimeterx · kasada · awswaf ·
    "Request unsuccessful" · errors.edgesuite.net · "Access Denied" ·
    CAPTCHA_SITE_KEY · <captcha …>

**Zero occurrences of every one of them, on every capture.** So
`BOT_CHALLENGE_MARKERS` is a short list of shapes that would have to appear
if this site ever turned a challenge on — it is a tripwire, not a description
of something observed, and it is documented as such so nobody later reads it
as evidence that a challenge was met. Per §18 the scan only ever REFINES the
reason for a page the policy already gave up on.

`cf-turnstile` is deliberately ABSENT from that list, per §19: 2Captcha's own
Scraping Browser auto-solve extension injects it into every page it loads, so
it fires on good pages and misses real ones. `challenges.cloudflare.com` is
the one that works, and it is what this list carries.

The positive structural signal is `/js/sys/`, which is the site's own script
directory: **9 to 11 references on every served page**, including the 404 and
the empty listing, and none on anything the site did not build. That is
CLAUDE.md §8's `assets.mmsrg.com` trick, which also answers Chromium's own
network-error page (§18) — it carries the site's hostname in its title and
would fool a title check.

    # itself (15 of the 20).

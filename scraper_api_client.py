kose-scraper — 2captcha Scraper API edition (fourth engine)
===========================================================
Fetches a Maison KOSÉ page through 2captcha's Scraper API — a hosted browser
reached over HTTP, with no Chromium to install locally and nothing to keep
running. The same parser reads the HTML it returns, so the rows are the rows
the browser engines produce.

Say it plainly rather than selling it (§13). **This site served an ordinary
datacentre address on every route measured** (2026-09-18, from netcup in
Nuremberg): a plain `curl`, a `python-requests` UA and a request with no
User-Agent header each got the same 90,310-byte listing, and twelve pages
back to back were twelve 200s. So this path is not a way past anything here.

What it IS good for on this site:

  * **No local browser.** One HTTP call per page, from anywhere that can
    reach the API — a small container, a lambda, a CI job with no Chromium
    layer. Measured 2026-09-18: one listing page, 90,835 bytes, 24 rows,
    $0.0005.
  * **Nothing to keep alive.** No profile, no CDP connection to hold open,
    no `profile_locked` to schedule around.

What it cannot do here:

  * **It cannot pick a market.** There is only one: maison.kose.co.jp is a
    single Japanese storefront with no `hreflang` set and no `/en/` route,
    so there is no locale for an exit to choose.
  * **It is one page per call.** Pagination is the caller's job; the browser
    engines walk a listing for you.

Usage:

    python scraper_api_client.py --key $TWOCAPTCHA_KEY \
        --url "https://maison.kose.co.jp/site/cosmedecorte/c/c15/"

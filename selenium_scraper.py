kose-scraper — Selenium edition
================================
The same scrape as `playwright_scraper.py`, driven by Selenium. Kept at
parity in behaviour rather than in priority: all three engines must agree on
exit codes, run status, and whether a run crashes or spends money (CLAUDE.md
§6). Verified on 2026-09-18 by running all three against the same two pages
of `/c/c15/` — **48 of 48 rows identical** on sku, price, brand and stock.

Read `playwright_scraper.py`'s docstring for what this site is and what is
odd about it. Two limits are this engine's own and belong in a README rather
than in a surprise:

* **It cannot use an authenticated remote CDP endpoint.** chromedriver's
  `debuggerAddress` takes a bare `host:port` with nowhere to put a password,
  while Playwright's `connect_over_cdp` and pyppeteer's `browserWSEndpoint`
  both authenticate on the WebSocket upgrade. So `--cdp-endpoint` against the
  Scraping Browser API is a Playwright or pyppeteer job.

* **`--proxy-server` cannot authenticate at all.** Credentials are stripped
  and a warning is printed rather than letting anyone believe a `user:pass`
  URL is doing something.

One measurement worth carrying: on the same listing this engine reports
**107** product-shaped links where Playwright reports 57, because more of the
page's own JavaScript has run by the time the DOM is read. Both parse the
same **24** rows, because rows come from tiles and not from links — which is
the whole argument for tile scoping, visible as a number.

    Maison KOSE server-renders its catalogue and has no JSON endpoint to

    (CLAUDE.md §21: ask what the front end calls before assuming a browser).
    Grepped across the captures for `/api/`, `/graphql`, `__NEXT_DATA__` and
    `__PRELOADED_STATE__`: zero hits on every listing and product page.

    So it is the URL the user gave, VERBATIM — including its page number if
    it names one. An earlier version normalised `/c/c15_p10/` back to
    `/c/c15/`, which meant a run pointed at page 10 quietly returned page 1's
    products and reported success. That is this codebase's most common bug
    class (§8), and the fix is simply to fetch what was asked for: §7's "page
    1 is fetched alone" is about the run's FIRST page deciding how far the
    rest can be addressed, not about the listing's first page.

    Counts from the page the run STARTED on rather than from 1: a run
    pointed at `/c/c15_p10/` with `--pages 3` reads 10, 11 and 12. The cap is
    the site's own `N／Mページ` counter where the route publishes one, applied
    to the absolute page number so the run stops at the real last page rather
    than after a fixed count.

    The convention is not guessed from the shape of page 1's URL: it is the
    one the site itself publishes in `<link rel="next">`, and `page_url`
    reproduces it byte for byte on both routes. That is the check §7 demands
    before trusting a constructed URL, and it matters here because getting it
    wrong is SILENT — `&pageno=2` and `&page=2` on a tag listing both return
    page 1 with HTTP 200.

    Capping is load-bearing rather than thrifty on this site: a category
    listing fetched past its last page returns THAT LAST PAGE AGAIN,
    byte-identical and HTTP 200, so an uncapped run collects duplicates
    instead of reaching an empty page. A tag listing publishes no counter and
    ends with a genuinely empty page, which is why the data-based stop stays
    in place for both.
